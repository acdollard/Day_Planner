# Day_Planner


## Description

This is a simple app for scheduling events from 9-5 throughout the day. The app utilizes the moment.js library to monitor the curret local time and will adjust the color of the textareas depending on whether the corresponding hour of box represents the past, present, or future. If the time slot is in the past, it turns red. If it's in the current hour, it's blue. If the time slot represents an hour in the future, it's green. When the user adds text and clicks the save button, their item is saved into local storage so the user can refresh the page and return to their calendar.
